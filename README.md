# Code2Code

This  repository ties to translate a source code into a target one, including Python/JAVA/C++/JS.

For exmample,

For a c++ source code,
<code>
#include<iostream>
using namespace tsd;
int main()
{
   int m=0;
   while(cin>>m)  
        cout<<m+1;
}
</code>

We would get a target Python code like
<code>
  while(m=input())
      print(int(m)+1)
</code>  

In order to reduce the complexity of this problem, exception check is not necessary for us.


Firstly, we should prepare well-organized parallel codes. Then we will provide a rule-base baseline and seq2seq baseline. 

The evaluation is based on these three parts:
- Rouge/Mentor/Belu metrics in machine translation
- Whether the generated code is runable
- Whether the code keeps coherent withÂ  the source code.

If possible a RL-based language model as a agent is welcome for this task, due to the rewards can be well-defined, e.g. whether the compiling process has no errors or the output is coherent as the source language with a same input.


It can be excepted that the Machine Agent could have a better performance over human in this task.
